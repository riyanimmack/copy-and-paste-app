# Copy and Paste App

A simple web-based application built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** that allows users to copy text from an input field and paste it into another section. This app uses JavaScript to handle text transfer internally without relying on clipboard functionality, offering a efficient text management solution.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML** for structure
- **CSS** for styling
- **JavaScript** for functionality

## How It Works
- The text from a field is stored in a variable when the **Copy** button is clicked.
- The input field is cleared immediately after copying.
- Clicking the **Paste** button displays the copied text in a separate section.

## Demo
Hereâ€™s how the app works:
1. Type text into the input field.
2. Click the **Copy** button to store the text.
3. Click the **Paste** button to display the copied text.
